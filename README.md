# BDIXscannerWeb
A simple tool to scan for available BDIX FTP Servers. If you are using internet connection from a BDIX connected or associated ISP, then you will be able to connect to these FTP servers. Here is a simple demo of my scanner tool. 
I scrapped the web and github for web server lists, and I added all I've found and wrote the name of the owners. 
This tool is written in pure javascript and CSS, I started the project at 2020 when I was learning javascript, and almost forgot about this. After so many years, I've found this out and had a thought to finish this project. So i finished it. Use it [here](https://tawsiftorabi.github.io/BDIXscannerWeb)
And if you want a more standalone solution like an app on your desktop, try this [sajjad-amin/BDIX-Tester: A desktop application for searching BDIX servers (ISPs of Bangladesh's shared server)](https://github.com/sajjad-amin/BDIX-Tester)
